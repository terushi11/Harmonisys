## Database Models

The project uses **Prisma** with a PostgreSQL database. Key models include:

- **User**: Authentication, roles, competency, and relations to forms.
- **Incident**: IRS incident reports (location, date, category, severity, etc.).
- **Unahon**: Mental health screening forms, checklists, and assessment types.
- **Checklist**: Linked to Unahon, stores checklist responses.
- **Submission**: MiSalud questionnaire submissions.
- **QuestionResponse**: Linked to Submission, stores answers.
- **PlaceCoordinate**: Used for mapping and GIS features.

See `prisma/schema.prisma` for full details.

## Environment Variables

You will need to configure the following (see `.env.example`):

- `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection string)
- **Firebase (IRS, MiSalud):**
    - `IRS_API_KEY`, `IRS_AUTH_DOMAIN`, `IRS_PROJECT_ID`, ...
    - `MISALUD_TYPE`, `MISALUD_PROJECT_ID`, `MISALUD_PRIVATE_KEY`, ...
- **NextAuth:**
    - `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- **Other:**
